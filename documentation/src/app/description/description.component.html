    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Are you dissatisfied with the current music bot situation on Discord? All your favourite music bots have been shut down? Do not worry, skeleton, the Music4You bot is here for you! Our bot offers audio playback from various websites, such as YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud for FREE! With the following <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=940645443359092806&scope=bot&permissions=8" target="_blank">invite link</a> you can immediately invite our bot to your own server. You can use the bot with typing -[command_name] in the chat, e.g: -connect</p>
    <p>Currently the bot is still in a development phase. The team is working hard to achieve the same level as the other shut down bots, even recreate the commands, which were once locked behind premium membership. The developer team is composed of four young students and the whole project is open source.</p>

    <h3>Technical information</h3>
    <p>The bot is using the <a href="https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/" target="_blank">Pycord</a> fork 3rd party library on Python version 3.10.2. For the audio streaming, we use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a> and <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/" target="_blank">youtube-dl</a>. Other than that, it is using the previously mentioned sites' open APIs. If you want to join our development, see our <a href="https://gitlab.com/simond-hue/discord-bot/" target="_blank">Gitlab repository</a>.</p>
